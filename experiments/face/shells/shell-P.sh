# You must set the error and output locations, as the default log output
# location is the directory you qsub'ed from. For instance, say I cd to
# "/home/whaun/blargh" and qsub from there, not specifying "-e" or "-o." The
# output location for the error and output logs is going to default to
# "/home/whaun/blargh." To make it easier you may add -e and -o to your job
# script so you do not have to specify them every qsub call. Ex.:
#$ -o $PWD/logs
#$ -e $PWD/logs

# when am I running
#/bin/date

# where am I running
